    <h3>
        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        This first part is taken and slightly modified from Fehr, Gachter (1999) "Cooperation and Punishment in Public Goods
        Games"
        
        You are now taking part in an economic experiment. If you read the following instructions carefully, you can, depending
        on your decisions, earn a considerable amount of money. It is therefore very important that you read these intructions
        with care.
        
        The instructions which we have distributed to you, are solely for your private information. It is prohibited to
        communicate with the other participants during the experiment. Should you have any questions please ask us. If you
        violate this rule, we shall have to excluded you from the experiment and from all payments.
        
        Each participant receives a lump sum payment of 25 pesos at the beginning of the experiment (as well as the 50 pesos for
        participating). This one-off payment can be used to pay for eventual losses during the experiment. However, you can
        always evade losses with certainty through your own decisions. At the end of the experiment your entire earnings from
        the experiment plus the lump sum payment and the 50 pesos will be immediately paid to you in cash.
        
        The experiment is divided into different periods. In all, the experiment consists of 15 periods. In each period the
        participants are divided into groups of four. You will therefore be in a group with 3 other participants. The
        composition of the groups will change by random after each period. In each period your group will therefore consist of
        different participants.
        
        In each period the experiment consists of two stages. At the first stage you have to decide how many points you would
        like to contribute to a project. At the second stage you are informed on the contributions of the three other group
        members to the project. You can then decide whether or how much to reduce their earnings from the first stage by
        distributing points to them.
