        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        The incentives are the following:
        <ul>
            <li> They pay a cost from protesting, which (perhaps, but is not necessary) diminishes with
            the number of protesters </li>
            <li> If enough protest, the regime switches. The switching function may be discrete (a
            threshold rule) or more continuous. If the regime switches, another regime is randomly
            selected. </li>
            <li> After the protest decision, there is a regime in place (either the same one if there was no
            switch, or whichever one was switched to). Call this regime n_hat. I have several versions
            of what the payoffs to this regime switch are. In all these versions, someone will be
            assigned a payoff that is decreasing in the value of the column chosen (between 1 and
            m) from row n_hat. 
            <ul>
                <li> Your interaction with the regime will be determined by a random draw from row
                n_hat. </li>
                <li> Perhaps m is equal to the number of subjects in the session (although with some
                extra work we could do a version of this even if the two values are not equal). Then
                subjects are told that theyâ€™ll be uniquely assigned to one of the m slots.</li>
                <li> Perhaps the cost of the regime affects others who are not deciding whether to
                protest. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
